# Backend Repository

Welcome to the backend repository! This repository contains the backend code for various projects including an e-commerce platform, a hospital management system, and a YouTube clone. Below you will find a brief overview of the projects and the technologies used.

## Projects Overview

1. **E-commerce Platform**: This project involves the backend development of an e-commerce platform. It includes functionalities such as user authentication, product management, order processing, and more.

2. **Hospital Management System**: The backend for a hospital management system has been implemented here. This includes features like patient management, appointment scheduling, staff management, etc.
