# Backend Learning Journey

Welcome to my GitHub repository named Backend! This repository serves as a documentation of my journey in learning backend development. Here's what I've learned so far and what I plan to learn next.

## Learned Topics
1. **Express.js**: I've learned how to build web applications and APIs using Express.js, a popular web application framework for Node.js.
2. **Data Modelling using Mongoose**: I've gained understanding on how to design and interact with MongoDB databases using Mongoose, an elegant MongoDB object modeling tool.
3. **MongoDB for Database**: I've learned how to work with MongoDB, a NoSQL database, for storing and retrieving data in my applications.
4. **Frontend and Backend Connections**: I've learned how to establish connections between the frontend and backend of my applications, enabling seamless communication and data exchange.

## Next Steps
Based on my learning journey and interests, here are the upcoming topics I plan to dive into:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**: Learn how to implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure my applications.
2. **RESTful API Design**: Explore best practices for designing RESTful APIs to create efficient and scalable backend services.
3. **Middleware**: Understand the concept of middleware in Express.js and how to use it to add functionality to my applications.
4. **Error Handling**: Learn strategies for handling errors effectively in my backend applications to improve reliability and user experience.
5. **Deployment**: Explore different methods and platforms for deploying my backend applications, ensuring they are accessible to users.
6. **Testing**: Gain knowledge on testing methodologies and frameworks for writing automated tests to verify the functionality of my backend code.
7. **GraphQL**: Dive into GraphQL, an alternative to RESTful APIs, and learn how to design and implement GraphQL schemas for my applications.

Stay tuned for updates on my learning journey as I continue to explore the exciting world of backend development.
